# Examples and Interactive Scala Shell (REPL)
Riak Spark connector comes with several sample programs and demos:

- [Simple Scala example](#simple-scala-example)
- [Simple Scala RiakTS example](#simple-scala-ts-example)
- [Simple Scala DataFrame example](#simple-scala-dataframe-example)
- [Simple Scala RiakTS DatFrame example](#simple-scala-ts-dataframe-example)
- [Simple Java example](#simple-java-example)
- [Simple Java RiakTS example](#simple-java-riakts-example)
- [OFAC demo](#ofac-demo)

It also comes with a helper for running a ready-to-go [bootstrapped Spark shell](#interactive-scala-shell).

## Building and Running Examples/Demos
1. All of the examples assume that you have a Riak KV or Riak TS cluster installed and running on localhost:8087. You can follow these guides to setup a Riak KV or Riak TS cluster: [Installing Riak KV](http://docs.basho.com/riak/kv/2.1.4/setup/installing/) and [Installing Riak TS](http://docs.basho.com/riak/ts/1.2.0/installing/).

2. If you don't have Maven installed, go to the [Maven download page](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and follow the installation instructions for your OS.

3. Then, install the dependencies (we will skip integration tests to speed things up):
```
mvn install -DskipTests
```

4. Extract REPL/Examples:
```
unzip examples/target/spark-riak-connector-examples-REPL.zip
```

5. Run the example or demo that you want by running `./bin/run-example <class> [params]`. For example: `./bin/run-example SimpleScalaRiakExample` will run the SimpleScalaRiakExample example locally.

## Interactive Scala Shell
The easiest way to start using Spark is through the Scala shell. You can begin using the Scala shell by running:
```
./bin/rspark-shell
```

The original Spark shell will run, bootstrapped with all necessary [imports](./src/main/repl/conf/rspark-shell-defaults.scala) and proper classpath.

## Simple Scala Example
This Scala example demonstrates how to use Riak Spark connector to query all data from the corresponding bucket.
This example creates test data in the Riak, pulls it back to Spark by utilizing RiakRDD, and as a result,
calculates the number of values loaded from the Riak bucket.

Run it locally:
```
./bin/run-example SimpleScalaRiakExample
```

## Simple Scala RiakTS Example
This Scala example demonstrates how to use Riak Spark connector to do range queries in TS and how to do the same in KV

Run it locally:
```
./bin/run-example SimpleScalaRiakTSExample
```

Sources [SimpleScalaRiakTSExample.scala](./src/main/scala/com/basho/riak/spark/examples/SimpleScalaRiakTSExample.scala)

## Simple Scala DataFrame Example
This Scala example demonstrates how to use Spark Dataframes with RiakKV 

Run it locally:
```
./bin/run-example dataframes.SimpleScalaRiakDataframesExample
```

Sources [SimpleScalaRiakDataframesExample.scala](./src/main/scala/com/basho/riak/spark/examples/dataframes/SimpleScalaRiakDataframesExample.scala)

## Simple Scala Riak TS DataFrame Example
This Scala example demonstrates how to use Spark Dataframes with Riak TS 

Run it locally:
```
./bin/run-example dataframes.SimpleScalaRiakTSDataframesExample
```

Sources [SimpleScalaRiakTSDataframesExample.scala](./src/main/scala/com/basho/riak/spark/examples/dataframes/SimpleScalaRiakTSDataframesExample.scala)

## Simple Java example
This Java example demonstrates how to use Riak Spark connector to query query Riak KV.
This example creates test data in the Riak, pulls it back to Spark by utilizing such features as full bucket read, 2i range query, 2i keys query, and query by keys.

Run it locally:
```
./bin/run-example SimpleJavaRiakExample
```
Sources [SimpleJavaRiakExample.java](./src/main/java/com/basho/riak/spark/examples/SimpleJavaRiakExample.java)

## Simple Java RiakTS example
This Java example demonstrates how to use Riak Spark connector to query query Riak TS.
This example creates test data in the Riak, pulls it back to Spark by utilizing range scan query.

Run it locally:
```
./bin/run-example SimpleJavaRiakTSExample
```
Sources [SimpleJavaRiakExample.java](./src/main/java/com/basho/riak/spark/examples/SimpleJavaRiakTSExample.java)

## OFAC demo
This demo shows how Riak and Spark can be used to analyze semi-structured data using Scala.

As part of its enforcement efforts, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) publishes a list of individuals and companies owned, controlled by, or acting for/on behalf of targeted countries. It also lists individuals, groups, and entities, such as terrorists and narcotics traffickers designated under programs that are not country-specific. Collectively, such individuals and companies are called "Specially Designated Nationals‚Äù (SDNs). Their assets are blocked and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from dealing with them.

More information about OFAC list can be found at [www.treasury.gov](http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx)

### Initial Data
All the data required for this demo will be downloaded automatically from the public internet copies.

We will download a public copy of the [SDN list from OFAC](http://www.treasury.gov/ofac/downloads/sdn.csv). In order to connect SDNs to their specific locations, we will be downloading an [address list](http://www.treasury.gov/ofac/downloads/add.csv). And, finally, we will download a [Stop words list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words) for the proper word frequency analysis.

### Calculated Metrics
In the demo we are going to generate descriptive and summary statistics from the OFAC dataset. As a part of our analysis we are going to calculate the following:

* How many unique SDNs are there in total? (see output during execution)
* Which distinct SDN Types does this dataset contain? (see output during execution)
* How many banned individuals per country are in OFAC list? (supporting chart: bar plot)
* How many marine vessels are on the list by country and by vessel type? (supporting chart: heat map)
* What is the probability distribution of the vessel tonnage for vessels on the list? (supporting chart: histogram)
* What are the most common titles of the individuals on the list? (see output during execution)

We'll support our answers by drawing appropriate charts.

You can run the demo locally by:
```
./bin/run-example demos.ofac.OFACDemo
```
