# Spark Riak Connector

Spark Riak connector allows you to expose data stored in Riak buckets as Spark RDDs, as well as output data from Spark RDDs into Riak buckets. 

## Compatibility
* Compatible with Riak KV, bundled inside BDP 1.x
* Compatible with Apache Spark 1.5.2 or later
* Compatible with Scala 2.10 or later
* Compatible with Java 8


## Features
* Exposes data in Riak KV bucket as Spark RDD
* Provides ability to construct an RDD from a given set of keys
* Provides ability to construct an RDD using an enhanced 2i query (a.k.a. full bucket read) 
* Allows parallel full bucket reads into multiple partitions
* Allows saving of an RDD into a specified Riak bucket and indexing results with 2i indexes
* Provides mapping and data conversion for JSON formatted values
* Provides ability to construct an RDD by using a 2i string index or a set of indexes
* Provides ability to construct an RDD by using a 2i range query or a set of ranges 
* Provides ability to perform range queries over Riak TS bucket
* Provides ability to construct Dataframes from Riak TS bucket


## Building
Prerequisite: Java 8 JDK must be installed

If you don't have Maven yet, go to [Maven download page](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and follow installation instructions for your OS.

Clone this repository, then build Spark Riak connector:

```
mvn clean install
```

Integration tests will be executed during the build, therefore the build may fail if there is no BDP Riak node running on `localhost:8087`. 
The following command should be used to skip integration tests:

```
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```
 
Once the connector is built there are several jars that are produced:
`spark-riak-connector/target/` contains `spark-riak-connector-1.0.0.jar` - this is the main connector jar. 

## Developing 

If you're planning to develop Spark applications in Java there is an additional jar
`spark-riak-connector-java-1.0.0.jar` in `spark-riak-connector-java/target/`.

Connector depends on the following libraries:
* guava-14.0.1.jar
* jackson-datatype-joda-2.2.2.jar
* joda-time-2.1.jar
* jackson-module-scala_2.10-2.4.4.jar
* jcommon-1.0.23.jar
* scala-java8-compat_2.10-0.3.0.jar
* dataplatform-riak-client-1.0.0.jar

All of these need to be referenced by your Spark application and accessible through driver program classpath. 
Please see below code snippets in Scala, or explore the source code of bundled examples in Java and Scala.
 
The following link can be used to manual download [dataplatform-riak-client-1.0.0.jar](https://bintray.com/basho/data-platform/com.basho.riak/view)
from the Bintray repository.

To download dataplatform-riak-client.jar automatically during the build, the following repository should be added to pom.xml:

```xml
<repository>
    <id>bintray</id>
    <url>https://dl.bintray.com/basho/data-platform</url>
    <releases>
        <enabled>true</enabled>
    </releases>
    <snapshots>
        <enabled>false</enabled>
    </snapshots>
</repository>
```

### Necessary imports

```scala
import com.basho.riak.client.core.query.Namespace
import com.basho.riak.spark.rdd.RiakFunctions
import org.apache.spark.{SparkContext, SparkConf}
import com.basho.riak.spark._
```

### Configuration

You can prepare `SparkContext` to connect to Riak by connecting your Spark application to Riak. You will need to set the below options for `SparkConf` object. These options are prefixed with `spark.` so that they can be recognized
from the spark-shell and set within the $SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-default.conf.

The following options are available on `SparkConf` object:

Property name                                  | Description                                       | Default value      | Riak Type
-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------
spark.riak.connection.host                     | IP:port of a Riak node protobuf interface         | 127.0.0.1:8087     | KV/TS
spark.riak.connections.min                     | Minimum number of parallel connections to Riak    | 10                 | KV/TS
spark.riak.connections.max                     | Maximum number of parallel connections to Riak    | 30                 | KV/TS
spark.riak.input.fetch-size                    | Number of keys to fetch in a single round-trip to Riak | 1000          | KV
spark.riak.input.split.count                   | Desired minimum number of Spark partitions to divide the data into | 10| KV
spark.riak.output.wquorum                      | Quorum value on write                                              | 1 | KV
spark.riak.connections.inactivity.timeout      | Time to keep connection to Riak alive in milliseconds | 1000 | KV/TS
spark.riakts.bindings.timestamp                | To treat/convert Riak TS timestamp columns either as a Long (UNIX milliseconds) or as a Timestamps during the automatic schema discovery. Valid values are: <ul><li>useLong</li><li>useTimestamp</li><ul> | useTimestamp | TS

Example:

```scala
val conf = new SparkConf()
        .setAppName("My Spark Riak App")
        .set("spark.riak.connection.host", "10.0.4.1:8087")
        .set("spark.riak.connections.min", "20")
        .set("spark.riak.connections.max", "50")

val sc = new SparkContext("spark://10.0.4.1:7077", "test", conf)
```

### Reading data from Riak bucket

First we need to specify which Riak bucket (i.e. bucket named `test-data`):

```scala

val SOURCE_DATA = new Namespace("test-data")
```

Then we have several options to construct an RDD:

1. Query by an explicit set of keys

```scala

val rdd = sc.riakBucket(SOURCE_DATA).queryBucketKeys("key-1", "key-2", "key-2")
```

2. Query by a given 2i numeric range

```scala
val idxName = "myIndex"
val from = 0L
val to = 1000L

val rdd = sc.riakBucket(SOURCE_DATA).query2iRange(idxName, from, to)
```

   or a set of ranges

```scala
val idxName = "myIndex"

val rdd = sc.riakBucket(SOURCE_DATA).partitionBy2iRanges(idxName, 1->3, 4->6, 7->12)
```

3. Query by a given 2i string tag or set of tags

```scala

val rdd = sc.riakBucket(SOURCE_DATA).query2iKeys("mon_data", "wed_data", "fri_data")
```

### Doing something useful with the data

Once the RDD is constructed all standard Scala Spark transformations and actions can be applied.

The simplest action counts all elements and prints out the count:

```scala

println(s"Element count: ${rdd.count()}")
```

### Saving results into Riak KV

To be able to write data out from an RDD into a Riak bucket the following import for a writer is needed:

```scala

import com.basho.riak.spark.writer.{WriteDataMapper, WriteDataMapperFactory}
```

Define the output bucket and issue `saveToRiak` method on an RDD:

```scala
val MY_OUTPUT_BUCKET = new Namespace("output-data")

rdd.saveToRiak(MY_OUTPUT_BUCKET)
```

### Reading data from Riak TS bucket

Riak TS buckets can be queried using sql() function:

```scala
val rdd = sc.riakTSBucket(tableName).sql(s"SELECT * FROM $tableName WHERE time >= $from AND time <= $to")
```

### Saving rdd to Riak TS bucket

Existing rdd of org.apache.spark.sql.Row> can be saved to Riak TS as follows

```scala
rdd.saveToRiakTS(TABLE_NAME);
```

## Examples

Riak Spark connector comes with several sample programs and demos that can be found in the [**examples** folder](./examples)
